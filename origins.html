   <p>
     The origins's of Valentines day are mostly unknown but there are popular theories that the day was meant to celebrate the death of St. Valentine. There are different iterations of who St. Valentine actually is but in all versions, Valentine is a martyr. One famous example is the man that was told to have been killed by emperor Gothicus. The easily recognizable phrase "from your valentine" is thought to have come from a priest who used it in a letter to a girl he had fallen in love with. Other theories suggest it was an effort to "christianize" the holiday 'Lupercalia'. Pope Gelasius had alreadu forbid it's celebration during the 5th century.
